# IS-5600-Final-Project
Written by: Christopher Fong

# Purpose
Project to demonstrate my understanding of how to create a web application using React and implement different technologies.

This project also demonstrates my ability to use basic GitHub features.


# HOW TO RUN
1. Download the GitHub project
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder
3. Run the command "npm start". This will start the web application and should open the project in your web browser.

# Features
This project is a simple list application that displays 5 different stocks.
It loads the data such as stock name, ticker, exchange, and per-share value from a JSON file.

There are buy and sell buttons that allow the user to purchase and sell different stocks.
It also calculates the total value of the stock owned.
